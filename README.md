# finding-suspect

A small Python app that lets the user create an	identikit picture of a person by sequentially rating images that are generated by a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE). After selecting the most similar images from a set of random or pre-generated faces, Gaussian process optimization is used to converge to an optimum that (hopefully) looks like the person the user had in mind.

This project was created during the final assignment for the Coursera course *Bayesian Methods for Machine Learning* (https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-methods-in-machine-learning) by Daniil Polykovskiy or Alexander Novikov from the Higher School of Economics in Moskow, Russia (https://www.hse.ru/en/).
